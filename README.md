## Algorithms

The programming language used is C++ with the optimization software CPLEX 12.4. 

### The Lagrangian algorithm for the 2-dock problem:

We propose a hybrid method based on a Lagrangian relaxation technique through the volume algorithm for the 2-dock problem. The program reads the number of jobs (n and m), two vectors composed by the processing times (machine 1 and machine two, respectively) and one matrix of precedence.

### Constructive Heuristics:

The Constructive Heuristics H1 and H2 use information from Lagrangian multipliers to sort jobs. In the final step both heuristics use an NEH-like heuristic to construct the feasible solution.

### JB Heuristic:

We programmed the best heuristic introduced by Chen and Lee (2009), which is based on Johnson's algorithm. The NEH algorithm and Local search are used to refine the results of JB in the same way than used in H1 and H2.

### CDH Heuristic:

Next you find the CDH heuristic proposed by Cota et al. (2016). The CDH heuristic starts by creating a preliminary schedule in the second machine. With this, a schedule is defined in the first machine and finally the second machine is rescheduled.

### Constructive Heuristic for parallel-dock CDC:

In this generalized version, the subproblems of the Lagrangian relaxation are NP-hard, and we work with their linear relaxations.

### Rescheduling approach to cross-docking truck scheduling problem with truck arrival time uncertainty: 

A Rescheduling Approach (RA) to a cross-docking truck scheduling problem with truck arrival time uncertainty is developed. The novelty of the proposed RA approach is the rescheduling strategy to generate efficient solutions even when dealing with uncertain arrival dates. We compared RA against two alternatives (without adjustments - WA), and perfect information - PI), and investigated the impact of the methods on two different problems Cmax and WC.

## Instances

### Instances for the 2-dock version:

The instances are composed by the number of jobs on machine 1, number of jobs on machine 2, processing times of the jobs on machine  1, 
processing times of the jobs on machine 2 and the matrix of precedence, that contain the list of jobs on machine 1 that are precedent on machine 2.

Example: [n5m3mp4_p1-10_1.txt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15XWvWe4JYu8wDSuSJc8JCW8hmfTu3ui6)

5  
3  
7 4 7 2 10  
4 10 3  
3 2 3 4  
2 0 1  
1 1 

* The first line correspond to the number of jobs on machine 1 (n=5);
* The second line correspond to the number of jobs on machine 2 (m=3);
* The third line correspond to the processing times of the n jobs on machine  1, for example, the processing time of job 3 (consider jobs from 0 to 4) on machine 1 is 2.
* The fourth line correspond to the processing times of the m jobs on machine  2, for example, the processing time of job 1 (consider jobs from 0 to 2) on machine 2 is 10.
* From the fifth line onwards we represent the matrix of precedence. The matrix is composed by m lines corresponding to m jobs on machine 2. 
* For each job on machine 2, there is a corresponding subset of jobs on machine 1 (second column onwards). It is considered that each element job on machine 2 has at least one job on  machine 1 as precedent. 

For example: The first line on the matrix correspond to the first job on machine 2 (3 2 3 4). It means that the first job on machine 2 has three jobs on machine 1  as precedent (first element of the matrix). These jobs are job 2, job 3, and job 4 on machine 1. 

The same reasoning happens for other jobs on machine 2, for example,  the second line on the matrix correspond to the second job on machine 2. Note that the second job on machine 2 has two jobs on machine 1  as precedent (first element of the matrix). These jobs are job 0 and job 1 on machine 1. And so on for all m jobs.

It is important to note that we consider jobs varying from 0.

#### Group of instances:

The instances used in this work are divided into two groups. In each group of instances, n is fixed and the number m is randomly chosen from the range of [0.6n, 0.8n, 1.0n, 1.2n, 1.4n]. For each n, five instances with different m values are considered. And for each pair (n, m), we generate 10 different problems, therefore the benchmark consists of 500 instances. All instances are available below:

|Group| Files |

| 2 | [Grupo 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EUnx33BeLzZSotX5A2Hf_Amed1hPBlY6) |

### Instances for the multi-dock version:

Artificial instances were generated varying the number of jobs and machines. We consider values of n1 equal to 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 jobs, and values of n2 equal to integers in [0.8n1, 1.2n1]. Five groups of instances were examined. The first three groups consider the same number of machines in each stage: 2, 4, and 10. The last two groups of instances use a random number of machines in each stage, selected from a uniform distribution U(2,4) and U(2,10), respectively. Processing times were generated with a uniform distribution U(10, 100). We generated 300 instances for each combination of number of jobs and number of machines, resulting in a total of 10.500 instances. All instances are available below:

### Instances for the Rescheduling Approach (RA):

We generate artificial instances varying the number of machines and jobs. We examine five groups of instances: the first three groups consider the same
number of machines on each stage, $2, 4$, and $10$. The last two groups of instances use a random number of machines on each stage,
selected from a discrete uniform distribution $U(2,4)$ and $U(2,10)$, respectively. In total, there are 45 instances for each group of instances, resulting in 225 cases.

Following we report computational results for the Complete Model (MIP) and heuristics JB, CDH, H1, and H2. The GAP(%) is computed as (Upper Bound - Lower Bound)/Upper Bound and the column T(s) refers to CPU time expended to solve the problem in seconds.

### Results for the multi-dock problem

In the following tables we report computational results obtained with heuristics JRH, JLPTH, CDH, H1 and H2 for large instances. In order to evaluate the heuristics proposed we used "Loss" as the criterion to balance the quality of each heuristic algorithm, 
Loss = (makespan - lower bound)/lower bound. For each combination of number of jobs and number of machines and for each heuristic we report best, average and worst percentage Loss over 300 instances, along with standard deviations.
